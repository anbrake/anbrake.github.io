## Hello! I am Aaron Brake.

I completed my BS degree in Industrial Math and Statistics, with an area of emphasis on Statistics, at West Virginia University. Bringing in many (~2 years worth) of college credits I completed in high school, I was able to graduate WVU in only 5 semesters. Before graduating, I was approached by the Alumni Association at WVU, with an offer to become their Data Analyst. I first started as an intern, and transitioned to full time after graduating in the Winter of 2018.


Continuing my education, I earned my MS in statistics from NC State University. During my time there, I was a TA for both undergraduate and graduate classes. My teaching ranged from Python to graduate level Statistical Methods. While completing my degree, I took many classes about modeling, and machine learning. Additionally, I completed Projects
