title: Common Statistical Questions and Answers
---

During my office hours and teaching during my graduate education, I encountered many of the same questions. Here are my (simpflied) answers to many common statistical questions and explanations of concepts: 

1) Power
 <!---The most common questions, and yet one of the hardest to properly define: What is statistical power? --->
 
2) There are two categories of Statistical (or Machine Learning, or Data Scince, or ...) models:  
Supervised:    
* This category of model involves data that is labeled, and the overall goal is to be able to accurately predict these labels.
* Supervised models come in two "flavors": predictive models, and intrepretable models. 

Unsupervised:  
* This category of model involves data with no pre-labeling, so the goals may be more broad. Grouping of the data, adding a label to perform supervised tasks, or simply doing more data visualizations/storytelling are all examples of tasks that would apply to unsupervised learning.
